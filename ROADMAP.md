## 📋 Planned — The AI Programming Language Arc

> **Vision**: Transform Vitalis from a compiled language *with* AI libraries into a language
> *built for* AI — where tensors are first-class types, every function is differentiable,
> the compiler optimizes itself, and programs can write, test, and improve themselves.
>
> Vitalis already has: self-modifying code (`@evolvable`), Thompson sampling compiler
> oracles, meta-evolution (learning to learn), bio-inspired memory (5 engram types),
> spiking neural networks (STDP, ESN, NEAT), and research-grade evolutionary algorithms
> (CMA-ES, NSGA-II, MAP-Elites, Novelty Search). The roadmap below builds on these
> foundations with a laser focus on **differentiable computing**, **neural architecture**,
> **self-improvement**, and **AI-native language semantics**.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **f32 as default precision** | All modern AI uses f32 or lower; f64 is 2× slower and unnecessary for neural nets |
| **Tape-based autograd** (not source-transformation) | More flexible for dynamic computation graphs, easier to implement, covers all control flow |
| **Goto-algorithm SIMD matmul** | Best known single-threaded matmul performance without external dependencies (BLAS) |
| **Thompson sampling for compiler decisions** | Already proven in `optimizer.rs`; extend to all compiler heuristics |
| **RoPE over sinusoidal positional encoding** | RoPE generalizes to unseen sequence lengths and is now standard (LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma) |
| **SwiGLU over ReLU FFN** | ~1% accuracy gain at same compute; standard in all modern transformers |
| **QLoRA for fine-tuning** | Enables fine-tuning of large models on consumer hardware (4-bit quantization) |
| **CEGIS for program synthesis** | Sound verification loop ensures synthesized code is correct, not just plausible |
| **PPO for RL** | Most stable policy-gradient algorithm; used in RLHF, robotics, and game AI |
